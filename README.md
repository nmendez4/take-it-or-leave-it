## Take It Or Leave It

Take it or Leave It is a comprehensive platform that lets users sign in and build a profile that allows them list used items for sale, and purchase items from other sellers. The site's products range from clothing and furniture to appliances and electronics. Our site cuts costs of major wholesale companies by connecting you with other retail sellers all across the US. Take it or Leave it has the lowest commission percentage of 5% compared to sites like offer up (7.9%) and Sidelineswap (12%).
